Client
The client is the primary user of the system. Their main focus is the protection of the integrity of their application. Their actions will only include the sending of packets and receiving of responses.  By using this system, they will be able to protect the integrity of their application and experience an increase to throughput by virtue of DoS protection and network load-balancing.  The client will use the front-facing segment of the system.  These users cannot cause much detriment to the system as their interaction will strictly be limited to interacting with the front-end interface. As such, they are expected to have no more knowledge other than how to use the (protected and balanced) application. These users are required to have some form of computing device which will be able to use the front-end system as well as a connection to the internet. 
Administrator
Administrators will have the duties of installing components of the system and maintaining its health and performance.  As these decisions will determine the success of the service as well as the level of security, they will require a level of skill that ensures this. These users would be expected to have experience with networking and some degree of software development and maintenance.  These users will be able to make changes to the system that are integral to its running, e.g. manually blacklisting IPs/IP ranges, adjusting packet filtering rules or removing services from protected pools.
