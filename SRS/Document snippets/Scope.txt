Defendr is to be a blackbox implementation of a DoS protection service, as well as a  network load-balancer for various back-end applications (henceforth called service collectively).  The service is to be situated between the client and server; request from the client are to pass through the service, dropping/blacklisting offending packets/IPs. The service should employ direct server return; responses from the server are to be sent directly back to the client, and not routed back via the service.\\
    \\
    Packets that are permitted to pass through DoS protection will then be subject to the load-balancer.  Various load-balancing pools with multiple instances of a back-end situated in them.  According to the algorithm that is managing the particular pool's load-balancing, packets will get passed to the intended back-end instance.\\
    \\
    The service will measure the validity of request packets sent to a protected service by two criteria: \# of packets per second, and \# of connections.  The limitations will be specified by the owner of the back-end being protected.\\
    \\
    The service will also comprise of two user interfaces; an administration interface, and an interface that is to be used by the back-end application's clients.  The former will provide access to metrics detailing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Current servers being protected
        \item Current status of the server, i.e. total \# of packets, \# of packets being let through (success rate), \# of packets being dropped (failure rate)
        \item A heat-map that displays the geo-location of the origin of client request to protected back-ends
        \item List of blacklisted IPs
        \item Internal overhead
    \end{itemize}
