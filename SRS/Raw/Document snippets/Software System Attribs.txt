%\subsection{Software System Attributes} %Reliability, Security, Availability, Interoperability requirements
         %   The purpose of this system is to protect the security and integrity of online applications by mitigating attempts to attack said applications by means of DoS attacks, however in doing so we must also ensure that a) packets are not corrupted by our service, and b) that the application throughput is not slowed down by the service.  This requirement intersects with the need to ensure that this very service does not impact the reliability and availability of the protected applications.  The security of a software system can also be impeached when it is placed under strain, e.g. injecting illegal/malicious code by means of buffer overflow, for that reason it is imperative that the service can properly handle attacks as it will be the intended recipient of attacks.\\

       %     In terms of network load-balancing, the end-goal is to optimise network traffic and up-time  whilst also minimising latency by routing packets to members in the pool that will give the packets optimal processing and the client a quick response by selecting the best instance in the pool.  This millisecond decision-making will affect the turnaround time of user requests, as well as the availability of the application.\\
         %   \\
    %        The system must also be able to interface with different applications types and client types.  This will be conducive for maintenance of the code as system changes will have few negative impacts on the interface between the client and service.  The same gain is present if additional features are added to the system.
