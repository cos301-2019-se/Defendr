#+TITLE: Advanced: XDP userspace delivery via AF_XDP
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

It is important to understand that XDP in-itself is not a kernel bypass
facility. XDP is an *in-kernel* fast-path, that operates on raw-frames
"inline" before they reach the normal Linux Kernel network stack.

To support fast delivery of /raw-frames into userspace/, XDP can *bypass*
the Linux Kernel network stack via XDP_REDIRECT'ing into a special BPF-map
containing AF_XDP sockets. The AF_XDP socket is an new Address Family type.
([[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/af_xdp.html][The kernel documentation for AF_XDP]]).

* Lessons

** Where does AF_XDP performance come from?

The AF_XDP socket is really fast, but what the secret behind this
performance boost?

One of the basic ideas behind AF_XDP dates back to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson][Van Jacobson]]'s talk about
[[https://lwn.net/Articles/169961/][network channels]]. It is about creating a Lock-free [[https://lwn.net/Articles/169961/][channel]] directly from
driver RX-queue into an (AF_XDP) socket.

The basic queues used by AF_XDP are Single-Producer/Single-Consumer (SPSC)
descriptor ring queues:

- The *Single-Producer* (SP) bind to specific RX *queue id*, and
  NAPI-softirq assures only 1-CPU process 1-RX-queue id (per scheduler
  interval).

- The *Single-Consumer* (SC) is one-application, reading descriptors from
  a ring, that point into UMEM area.

There are *no memory allocation* per packet. Instead the UMEM memory area
used for packets is pre-allocated and there by bounded. The UMEM area
consists of a number of equally sized chunks, that userspace have registered
with the kernel (via XDP_UMEM_REG setsockopt system call). *Importantly*:
This also means that you are responsible for returning frames to UMEM in
timely manner, and pre-allocated enough for your application usage pattern.

The [[http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/vj/lca06vj.pdf][transport signature]] that Van Jacobson talked about, are replaced by the
XDP/eBPF program choosing which AF_XDP socket to XDP_REDIRECT into.

** Details: Actually four SPSC ring queues

As explained in the [[ https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/af_xdp.html][AF_XDP kernel doc]] there are actually 4 SPSC ring queues.

In summary: the AF_XDP /socket/ has two rings for *RX* and *TX*, which
contain descriptors that points into UMEM area. The UMEM area has two rings:
*FILL* ring and *COMPLETION* ring. In the *FILL* ring: the application gives
the kernel a packet area to *RX* fill. In the *COMPLETION* ring, the kernel
tells the application that *TX is done* for a packet area (which then can be
reused). This scheme is for transferring ownership of UMEM packet areas
between the kernel and the userspace application.

** Gotcha by RX-queue id binding

The most common mistake: Why am I not seeing any traffic on the AF_XDP
socket?

As you just learned from above, the AF_XDP socket bound to a *single
RX-queue id* (for performance reasons). Thus, your userspace program is only
receiving raw-frames from a specific RX-queue id number. NICs will by
default spread flows with RSS-hashing over all available RX-queues. Thus,
traffic likely not hitting queue you expect.

You *MUST* configure NIC *HW filters* to /steer to RX-queue id/. This can be
configured by use of ethtool or TC HW offloading filter setup.

TODO: This lesson should contain some examples on howto use ethtool.

Alternative work-arounds:
1. Create as many AF_XDP sockets as RXQs, and have userspace poll()/select
   on all sockets.
2. For testing purposes reduce RXQ number to 1,
   e.g. via command =ethtool -L <interface> combined 1=

** Driver support and zero-copy mode

As hinted in the intro (driver level) support for AF_XDP depend on drivers
implementing the XDP_REDIRECT action. For all driver implementing the basic
XDP_REDIRECT action, AF_XDP in "copy-mode" is supported. The "copy-mode" is
surprisingly fast, and does a single-copy of the frame (including any XDP
placed meta-data) into the UMEM area. The userspace API remains the same.

For AF_XDP "zero-copy" support the driver need to implement and expose the
API for registering and using the UMEM area directly in the NIC RX-ring
structure for DMA delivery.

Depending on your use-case, it can still make sense to use the "copy-mode"
on a "zero-copy" capable driver. If for some-reason, not all traffic on a
RX-queue is for the AF_XDP socket, and the XDP program multiplex between
XDP_REDIRECT and XDP_PASS, then "copy-mode" can be relevant. As in
"zero-copy" mode doing XDP_PASS have a fairly high cost, which involves
allocating memory and copying over the frame.

* Missing elements

*Lesson incomplete*

This lesson is missing some assignments, but first we need to provide an
AF_XDP sample program. The sample should use the libbpf API for AF_XDP
sockets. It also need to include an actual XDP bpf program that is more
robust, and demonstrate how to read the RXQ-info about the RX-queue number,
and only redirect if the RX-queue id match, and maybe give stats on redirect
vs. XDP_PASS (not matching RX-queue id) packets.

Note: One of the reasons for providing a BPF C-code example is that the
kernel removed =samples/bpf/xdpsock_kern.c=, when libbpf was extended with
static BPF-instructions for AF_XDP redirect.
