End-user documentation
======================

This part of the XDP documentation is targeted at end-users, describing
how to use and setup XDP.

The XDP program running (inside the driver hook point) is an eBPF
program.  eBPF is a general kernel facility not restricted to the XDP
use-case. Thus, have its own documentation here: :doc:`../../../bpf/index`.
This documentation is focused on using eBPF for the XDP specific
use-case.
