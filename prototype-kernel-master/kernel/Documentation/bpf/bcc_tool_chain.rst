=============================
BCC (BPF Compiler Collection)
=============================

BCC is a toolkit to make eBPF programs easier to write, with
front-ends in Python and Lua.  BCC requires LLVM and clang (in version
3.7.1 or newer) to be available on target, because BCC programs do
runtime compilation of the restricted-C code into eBPF instructions.

BCC includes several useful tools_ and examples_, developed by
recognized performance analyst `Brendan Gregg`_ and covered with a
tutorial_ and slides_.

The project maintains an overview of `eBPF supported kernels`_ and
what versions got which specific features.  There is also a `BCC
Reference Guide`_.
