======================================
eBPF - extended Berkeley Packet Filter
======================================

Introduction
============

The Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) started (`article 1992`_) as a
special-purpose virtual machine (register based filter evaluator) for
filtering network packets, best known for its use in tcpdump. It is
documented in the kernel tree, in the first part of:
`Documentation/networking/filter.txt`_

The extended BPF (eBPF) variant has become a universal in-kernel
virtual machine, that has hooks all over the kernel.  The eBPF
instruction set is quite different, see description in section "BPF
kernel internals" of `Documentation/networking/filter.txt`_ or look at
this `presentation by Alexei`_.

Areas using eBPF:
 * :doc:`../networking/XDP/index`
 * `Traffic control`_
 * Sockets
 * Firewalling (``xt_bpf`` module)
 * Tracing
 * Tracepoints
 * kprobe (dynamic tracing of a kernel function call)
 * cgroups

Documentation
=============

The primary user documentation for extended BPF is in the man-page for
the `bpf(2)`_ syscall.

An excellent `BPF and XDP Reference Guide`_ is being maintained by the
`Cilium project`_.

This documentation is focused on the kernel tree's `samples/bpf/`_ and
`tools/lib/bpf/`_.  It is worth mentioning that other projects exist,
like :doc:`bcc_tool_chain`, that has a slightly different user-facing
syntax, but is interfacing with the same kernel facilities as those
covered by this documentation.
